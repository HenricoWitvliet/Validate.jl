    Validator

    Vector of Dicts to hold validation rules.

    Rules have at least a `name` to uniquely identify a rule and an `expr`
    holding the definition of a rule as a Julia expression. 
    An expression is given in terms of equalities or inequalities between columns of a
    DataFrame.  The result of the expression must be a boolean vector. The collection of
    allowed operations is given in `OPERATORS`. Furthermore, the function `is.na` can be
    used. It returns true for any element which is Julia-missing.
"""

"""
    Validation

    Struct to hold both the rules and the result of a confrontation.
    Fields are

    - rules: Validator-type holding all used rules
